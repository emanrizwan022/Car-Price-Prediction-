Car Price Prediction Using Linear and Logistic Regression

This project involved developing a comprehensive car price prediction model utilizing both linear and logistic regression techniques. The dataset comprised various car features, including model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, mpg, engine size, and manufacturer. The process began with thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies.

Two models were built for this task: one using built-in linear and logistic regression functions, and another from scratch, to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics and to compare performance. Feature engineering was conducted to enhance the predictive power of the models, and multiple evaluation metrics were employed to assess their accuracy and robustness.

By successfully predicting car prices based on multiple attributes, the project demonstrated a strong ability to apply machine learning methodologies to real-world data. This experience underscores proficiency in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, along with a solid understanding of regression techniques and their practical applications in predictive analytics
